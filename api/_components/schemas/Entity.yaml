      Null is valid. A Legal Entity Identifier (or LEI) is an international identifier made up of a
      20-character identifier that identifies distinct legal entities that engage in financial
      transactions. It is defined by ISO 17442.[1] Natural persons are not required to have an LEI;
      theyâ€™re eligible to have one issued, however, but only if they act in an independent business
      capacity.[2] The LEI is a global standard, designed to be non-proprietary data that is freely
      accessible to all.[3] As of December 2018, over 1,300,000 legal entities from more than 200
      countries have now been issued with LEIs.
